Quorabox
--------
Quorabox is a Google Chrome extension that lets you get Quora autocomplete
results right from your Google Chrome omnibox.

###How to Use
Type "qbox" on your Omnibox and press Tab to start your Quora search.

###Author's Note
This is one of those ideas that I've had for quite a while, but haven't quite found the time
to create it yet. When I saw Quora is having a competition on creating browser extension
and my day job workload isn't on its all-time high, I thought why not create it now. 

I know it's not strictly in alignment with the requirement of the competition,
but I hope it creates enough value for the community nonetheless.

Currently the extension is unpublished in the Web Store; I'll probably get it 
published in the next week or two. The only way to test it currently is to 
load it as an unpacked extension on the Developer mode.
