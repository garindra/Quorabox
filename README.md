###Author's Note
This is one of those ideas that I've had for quite a while, but haven't quite found the time
to create it yet. When I saw Quora is having a competition on creating browser extension
and my day job workload isn't on its all-time high, I thought why not create it now. 

I know it's not strictly in alignment with the requirement of the competition,
but I hope it creates enough value for the community nonetheless.
